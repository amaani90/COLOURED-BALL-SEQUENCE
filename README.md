# COLOURED-BALL-SEQUENCE

Through this project, I want to show how a machine may choose a group of colored balls from a box full of various colored balls based on the ones you provide.
Red, Green, and Blue are the series I've chosen for this project. To get one count, we must choose three of each color—red, blue, and green—in any combination from the array of colored balls in the box. Counting down from one indicates that the selected series is now finished. 

This is done with the help of mealy machine conceptwithout overlapping.

A Mealy machine is a finite state machine with an output value rather than a terminal state. The device produces a matching output for a given input. The current state of the FA and the current input symbol affect the Mealy machine's output.Mealy machines determine the output in relation to the input, unlike other finite automata that decide if a certain string is acceptable in a given language.
